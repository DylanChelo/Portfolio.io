    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello my name is Dylan Chelo and this is my website that you are currently viewing.  
      I am going to be a sophomore at URI this fall semester, I major in computer science and plan to minor in cyber security.  
      Some of my hobbies include playing soccer, going to the beach, and I love to snowboard during the winter.
      This is the first time that I have created a website and I really hope you enjoy it!
    </p>
